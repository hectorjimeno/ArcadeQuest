# ArcadeQuest
Arcade Quest is my final degree project. It's a classic-inspired videogame made entirely using Godot and GDScript.

Here you can download the demo (Windows x64) for Arcade Quest in the ArcadeQuest.zip file containing:

## ArcadeQuest.exe
## ArcadeQuest.pck
## ArcadeQuestInstructions.jpg

In order to run the demo you need to unzip the file and have both the .exe and the .pck in the same folder.

Have fun!
